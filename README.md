# Customer-Response-Prediction

Classification task to predict whether or not customers respond to a marketing campaign. Modelling techniques used include logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, model stacking, and neural networks. Employed the train-validate-test workflow to tune hyperparameters and select a final model. Evaluated the final model by analysing a confusion matrix, taking into account that a false negative was valued at 3x worse than a false positive. The entire Jupyter notebook was written in two days as part of a take-home exam for QBUS3820 (Machine Learning and Data Mining in Business).
